      "answer": "This is explained by Newton's First Law, also known as the Law of Inertia. An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Your body continues moving forward because there is no force immediately stopping it, until the seatbelt or another force acts on you.",

      "answer": "Using Newton's Second Law, F = ma. We can solve for mass (m) by rearranging the equation: m = F / a. Substituting the values: m = 20N / 2 m/s\u00b2 = 10 kg. So, the mass of the shopping cart is 10 kg.",
