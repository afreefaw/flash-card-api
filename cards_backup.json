      "answer": "Newton's First Law states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. This is also known as the Law of Inertia.",

      "answer": "Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that whenever an object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction.",

      "question": "You are riding in a car that suddenly comes to a stop. Your body lurches forward even though the car has stopped. Which of Newton's Laws explains this, and why?",
      "answer": "This is explained by Newton's First Law, also known as the Law of Inertia. An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Your body continues moving forward because there is no force immediately stopping it, until the seatbelt or another force acts on you.",

      "answer": "Using Newton's Second Law, F = ma. We can solve for mass (m) by rearranging the equation: m = F / a. Substituting the values: m = 20N / 2 m/s\u00b2 = 10 kg. So, the mass of the shopping cart is 10 kg.",
